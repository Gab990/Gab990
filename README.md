- Hi, Iâ€™m Gabor Sebestyen, a web developer from the UK. I've been working on a couple of project in the past 2 years while studying for my degree to become a full-stack dev.

- The main focus of my work is front-end development and advanced and unique programming skills like Augmented and Virtual Reality websites, 3-Dimensional websites.

- Currently I'm trying to wrap my head around WebRTC and advanced back-end languages to be able to find a job which lets me grow.

- Main languages and frameworks I'm currently using are: HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, PHP, A-Frame, Three.js

- You can check out all the projects I've created on my website (still under development, will update with a link when done).

- Currently looking to work on projects that seem interesting and push web developmnent to new areas by embracing new technologies. Also, anything cool.
